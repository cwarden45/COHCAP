## COHCAP: R package for DNA Methylation Analysis (and Gene Expression Integration) for Illumina Infinium Array and BS-Seq Data

```diff
+ The COHCAP package was first developed within the Bioinformatics Core, under the direction of Yate-Ching Yuan.
+ Charles Warden also provided assistance with updates and maintance that include a Bioconductor version of the package
+ while working in the Integrative Genomics Core (with Xiwei Wu as the director) as well as when he was/is not working at City of Hope.
+
+ Accordingly, Charles Warden, Yate-Ching Yuan, and Xiwei Wu were listed as authors (when a Bioconductor version was available).
